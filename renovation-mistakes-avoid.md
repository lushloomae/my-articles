# Top Interior Design Mistakes to Avoid During Home Renovation in Dubai

Renovating your home in Dubai can be an exciting journey, but it also comes with challenges—especially when it comes to interior design. From choosing the wrong materials to overlooking the importance of layout, small mistakes can lead to big regrets. Here are some of the most common interior design mistakes to avoid during a home or [**apartment renovation in Dubai**](https://lushloom.ae/service/apartment-renovation/), and how working with experts like **Lush Loom** can help you get it right from the start.

## 1. Ignoring the Climate

Dubai’s hot and humid climate should be a major factor when selecting materials and finishes. For example, [**wooden flooring**](https://lushloom.ae/collection/flooring/wooden/) might warp without proper treatment, and certain fabrics can fade quickly in harsh sunlight. Instead, opt for durable and climate-appropriate options like SPC or [**vinyl flooring Dubai**](https://lushloom.ae/collection/flooring/vinyl/), which are available in a variety of stylish finishes at Lush Loom.

## 2. Choosing Style Over Function

While aesthetic appeal is important, your home also needs to be functional. Avoid picking trendy designs that don’t suit your daily lifestyle. For example, open shelving might look great but could collect dust quickly. Lush Loom offers expert consultation to help balance visual appeal with practicality—so your space looks good and works well too.

## 3. Poor Lighting Decisions

Many homeowners overlook the impact of lighting on interior design. A poorly lit room can make even the most beautiful interiors feel dull. Make sure to layer different types of lighting—ambient, task, and accent—to bring out the best in your furniture, flooring, and wall decor. The right flooring tone from Lush Loom can even enhance how natural and artificial light plays in the room.

## 4. Skipping Professional Help

DIY can be tempting, but interior design involves much more than choosing colors and furniture. It’s about flow, proportion, and cohesion. Working with professionals, like the design team at Lush Loom, ensures that every element of your home—from curtains to flooring—is harmonized and expertly installed.

## 5. Neglecting Flooring and Wall Finishes

Often, homeowners invest in furniture and decor but treat flooring and walls as an afterthought. However, these surfaces set the foundation for your entire interior look. Lush Loom offers a wide selection of [**flooring Dubai**](https://lushloom.ae/collection/flooring/) , wallpapers Dubai, and wall panels that are not only stylish but also built for Dubai’s environment.
